The purpose of this program was to visualize the data that I collected after simulating the deflection in a beam 
with a software called Ansys. It takes temperature, Young's Modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, and deformation
from the excel file and compares it to the theoretical values we get using textbook estimation techniques. It
generates plots that illustrate how deformation compares to the 3 former independent variables.
